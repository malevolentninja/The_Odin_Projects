## Part One: Easy version = Google Homepage Mockup

### Odin Notes: 
"DONT BE A PERFECTIONIST! You're just trying to make it look like google.com, not actually function like it and it doesn't have to be spaced exactly the same way to the pixel. Any dropdown menus or form submissions or hover-highlighting should be ignored."


## Part Two: Difficult Version = Google.com search results page

This is an optional piece of work for the course.

### Odin Notes
"Reuse much of your code from before...just focus on placement and order of items on the page."


## My Result

Google Homepage Status: Incomplete

Google.com search results page status: Incomplete
