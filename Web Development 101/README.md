### Project: Installations

Install the following on your computer: 
- Ruby
- Git
- Heroku
- Text Editor
- Ruby Gems
- RVM
- Rails
- Mac: XCode

#### My Experiences:

- I have a linux laptop with peppermint so I gained experience installing and
working with the command line to ensure these applications are all able to run. 

- I have a mac laptop for my main coding which already had ruby installed and also I had git ready for when I work on my Github files. Thankfully XCode was also preinstalled so that left me with less to try and install. 

- The Text Editor I already use is sublime text but on my linux laptop I installed Vim for later learning.
