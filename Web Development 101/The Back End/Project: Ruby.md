# Project Ruby: Challenges

This exercise will involve a lot of figuring things out. There aren't very detailed instructions for what to do, just the batch of tests that you need to make pass. You need to look at those tests, figure out what they want based on the error messages you receive, and write the code to pass them. It can be tricky to get the hang of at first but once you start making those tests go green it starts feeling pretty cool.
