pp, what things generally look like, and what you don't know. When you get to the end of this project, you can consider yourself remarkably persistent and resilient.

Because you'll be doing so much stuff that we haven't taught you yet, this is a good project to find a partner to work with on even though it's just following a tutorial.



Do the Jumpstart Lab's Blogger Tutorial sections I0 through I4. Pay attention to any error messages you get, both planned (because the tutorial walks you through a common error-guided workflow) and unplanned (likely for things like spelling errors). You'll see all these messages again and again when you're building Rails apps, so it's helpful to start getting familiar with which portions of the message you should pay attention to (and maybe put into Google if you can't figure out what caused it).
Here's a helpful gist with common Blogger problems if you're running into issues with routes, deleting, partials, and redirect_to.
If you're feeling ambitious, add in authentication in section I5.
If you're feeling very ambitious, try doing the final Extras section I6.
Don't forget to deploy your app to Heroku! Review Heroku deployment here.
